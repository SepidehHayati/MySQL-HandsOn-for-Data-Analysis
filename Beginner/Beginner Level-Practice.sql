-- JOIN (inner join, left join, right join)

-- INNER JOIN:
-- Q 1: Retrieve the first_name, last_name, and salary of employees by joining employee_demographics with employee_salary.
-- This type of join retrieves only the rows where there is a match between the two tables based on the condition specified.
SELECT EM.first_name, EM.last_name, SA.salary
FROM employee_demographics AS EM
INNER JOIN employee_salary AS SA
ON EM.employee_id = SA.employee_id;

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

-- Q 2: Retrieve a list of all employees along with their occupation and salary.
SELECT dem.first_name, dem.last_name, sal.occupation, sal.salary
FROM employee_salary AS sal
INNER JOIN employee_demographics AS dem
ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

-- Q 3: Retrieve the first_name, last_name, and occupation of all employees whose salary is greater than 60,000.
SELECT dem.first_name, dem.last_name, sal.occupation, sal.salary

INNER JOIN employee_salary AS sal
ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
WHERE sal.salary > 60000;

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

-- Q 4: Retrieve the first_name, last_name, age, and occupation of all employees who work in department 1.
SELECT dem.first_name, dem.last_name, sal.occupation, sal.salary, sal.dept_id
FROM employee_demographics AS dem
INNER JOIN employee_salary AS sal
ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
WHERE sal.dept_id = 1;

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

-- LEFT JOIN
-- Q 5: Retrieve all employees from employee_demographics, even if they donâ€™t have a salary record in employee_salary.
-- Explanation: A LEFT JOIN ensures that all records from employee_demographics are shown, even if there is no corresponding entry in employee_salary.
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, dem.last_name, sal.employee_id, sal.occupation, sal.salary
FROM employee_demographics AS dem
LEFT JOIN employee_salary AS sal
ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

-- RIGHT JOIN
-- Q 6: Retrieve all records from employee_salary, even if the employee doesn't exist in employee_demographics.
-- Explanation: A RIGHT JOIN ensures that all records from employee_salary are shown, even if there is no match in employee_demographics.
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, dem.last_name, sal.employee_id, sal.occupation, sal.salary
FROM employee_demographics AS dem
RIGHT JOIN employee_salary AS sal
ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

-- Q 7: FULL OUTER JOIN (Simulated with UNION)
-- Question: Retrieve all employees, including those with and without salary records, combining the LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, dem.last_name, sal.employee_id, sal.occupation, sal.salary
FROM employee_demographics AS dem
LEFT JOIN employee_salary AS sal
ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
UNION 
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, dem.last_name, sal.employee_id, sal.occupation, sal.salary
FROM employee_demographics AS dem
RIGHT JOIN employee_salary AS sal
ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id;

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

-- Q 8: SELF JOIN
-- This section is reserved for any self-join queries, which can be added here.
-- Self joins are used to combine rows in a table with other rows in the same table based on a related column.
