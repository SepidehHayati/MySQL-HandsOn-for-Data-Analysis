# MySQL-Tutorials

This repository contains SQL files created as part of the Alex Bootcamp, which covers three levels of SQL learning: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**. 
Each folder contains files related to:
  - Specific topics with examples from each level
  - A practice file for hands-on query exercises.

## Folder Structure

- **Beginner MySQL**: This folder includes the basic SQL concepts, organized into 5 lesson files:
  - Writing basic `SELECT` queries
  - Filtering data with `WHERE` clauses
  - Grouping data using `GROUP BY` and ordering them with `ORDER BY`
  - Filtering data with `HAVING` clauses
  - Using `LIMIT` and creating aliases with `AS`
  - The `Beginner Level Practice` file contains various practice queries to review and reinforce the basic concepts.

- **Intermediate MySQL**: In this folder, 6 more complex MySQL topics are covered, including:
  - Joining tables using different types of `JOIN`
  - Using `UNION` to combine result sets
  - Applying String functions for text manipulation
  - Implementing conditional logic with `CASE` statements
  - Writing Subqueries for more complex queries
  - Using Window functions for advanced data analysis
  - The `Intermediate Level Practice` Contains intermediate-level queries to practice the topics covered.

- **Advanced MySQL**: This section covers 4 advanced techniques for working with large datasets and more sophisticated MySQL concepts:
  - Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for temporary result sets
  - Creating and using temporary tables (Temp Tables)
  - Writing and executing Stored Procedures for modular query management 
  - Working with Triggers and Events for automatic database management
  - The `Advanced Level Practice` contains challenging queries and exercises for applying advanced MySQL concepts in real-world scenarios.


## How to Use

Each folder contains SQL files that build upon MySQL concepts at each level. To use:
1. Start by running the dataset file in each folder to create tables and insert sample data for the lessons.
2. Open the `.sql` file for the lesson in your SQL environment.
3. Run the queries step-by-step to see how the output changes.
4. Use the practice file to apply what you've learned.


## Prerequisites

To run these MySQL scripts, you'll need:
- **MySQL** or a similar SQL database installed on your machine.
- A basic understanding of SQL commands and how to execute them within a database management tool.

## Goals

The goal of this repository is to:
- Help beginners build a strong foundation in MySQL.
- Guide intermediate users through complex concepts such as joins, unions, and window functions.
- Challenge advanced users with techniques like CTEs, temporary tables, stored procedures, and triggers.

Feel free to modify the queries or create your own as you progress through each level!
